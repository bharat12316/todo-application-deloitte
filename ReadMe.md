Security:

As mentioned in the Write up document the application uses BCrypt hashing technique for security purpose. I wanted to mention few more security oprtions which I would have implemented if I had more time. I would have preferred using a Basic authentication using Spring Security(eextending the WebsecurityConfigurerAdapter Class) or JWT(JSON web tokens) token in this assignment. If the users were logging in real time I would have preferred OAuth 2 (Using Google or GitHub account).

Please consider this as one the improvements which I missed to mention in my write up. Thank you.
